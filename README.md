# Quantum-Kernel-Enhanced-Hybrid-Models-for-Start-Up-Success-Prediction

Developed a hybrid Quantum-CNN model that integrates quantum kernel preprocessing into a classical CNN, using venture capital data from Crunchbase to classify start-ups as successful or unsuccessful.

Demonstrated that Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs) achieve competitive accuracy (~66%) with classical models (up to 68%), and the hybrid quantum-CNN model achieved 70% accuracy, outperforming standalone methods.

Showcased the potential of quantum kernel feature mapping in enhancing learning on real-world, noisy datasetsâ€”paving the way for Quantum Machine Learning (QML) applications in financial analytics and VC decision-making.
